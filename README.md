### What does the Noorsoft web application solve?
[Noorsoft web applications](https://github.com/krilpil/noorsoft "Web application for operators") is part of Noorsoft-Mobile.   
A web application is an interface for interacting with clients who have any difficulties.  

### What is Noorsoft-Mobile?

Noorsoft-Mobile is an integral part of the overall Noorosft system.  
Only in this application customers can ask questions to the support service.  

## How does it work?

### The first stage

The user has a problem and needs to contact the manager to get help. To do this, he downloads Noorsoft-Mobile. Passes authorization 
or registration in the system. Formulates the problem and writes to the support chat.

### The second stage

At the other end of the wire, the operator sees this message and puts the client into active mode. This means that the client's 
problem has been taken into consideration. It is very important to understand that now only one operator sees this message. 
Because he switched it to activity mode.

### The third stage

Depending on how the dialogue with the client went, the operator can transfer it to separate categories of messages - saved or closed. 
The categories of messages will be described below.

## Message categories

The message is divided into 4 categories:

### Pending

The "Pending" category contains messages from customers who have not yet been accepted by operators. All operators see these messages.

### Active

The "Active" category contains messages from clients that the operator has accepted for work. These messages are seen only by the operator
who received these messages. In this category, the main discussions with the client are conducted.

### Saved

The "Saved" category contains messages from clients that the operator has saved for further work. These messages are seen only by 
the operator who received these messages. This category is intended for those moments when the operator is forced to postpone solving
problems due to any reason. 

### Closed

The "Closed" category contains messages from clients that the operator has saved for further work. These messages are seen only by the operator
who received these messages. This category is intended for completed dialogs.

## How does the search work?

The search searches for posts in separate categories. To select this category, click on one of the icons below the search bar.
Each icon means the status of dialogs: pending, active, saved, close. The search is carried out only by precisely typed values. 

It is important to clarify that the dialog searches not in the dialog, but in a variety of dialogs of the selected category.
